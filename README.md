develop: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PileProject/drivecommand.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/PileProject/drivecommand)

A general library written in Java which enables robots and devices
to communicate with each other through the same interface.

### Available robots
We currently support 3 robots:
- [LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-NXT-2-0-8547)
- [LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313)
- [PILE Original Robot](http://pileproject.com/en.html)

They can communicate with any device (PC, Android, etc.) with this library.

## Installation
### From gradle
Please write the following codes in your `build.gradle`.

```
repositories {
    maven { url 'http://pileproject.github.io/drivecommand/' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.pileproject:drivecommand:VERSION'
}
```

[v2.3.0](https://github.com/PileProject/drivecommand/releases/tag/v2.3.0) is the latest version.

### From jar file
After building sources (See [Build](#build)),
you can find `drive-command.jar` in `build/libs`.

## Build
Linux & OS X:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

Windows:

```sh
./gradlew.bat build
```


## Run Test and Generate Javadoc
Linux & OS X:

```sh
./gradlew test
./gradlew javadoc
```

Windows:
```sh
./gradlew.bat test
./gradlew.bat javadoc
```

Test reports will be generated in build/reports/tests (See index.html).
Javadocs will be generated in build/docs/javadoc (See index.html).


## Usage example
To use this library, you should prepare an implementation of
[`ICommunicator`][ICommunicator] to specify the master device (PC, Android, etc.).

As an example, we are developing [drive][drive],
an Android application that controls EV3/NXT/Pile Robot
and it uses [`BluetoothCommunicator`][BluetoothCommunicator],
which is an implementation of `ICommunicator`,
to control robots
with an Android device via Blutooth.
<!--
In `BluetooothCommunicator`,
we open Input/Output streams to communicate robots in `open()`
and close them in `close()`.
-->

After preparing an implementation of `ICommunicator`,
you can make an object of an implementation of [`MachineBase`][MachineBase]
and access to a robot.
In [drive][drive],
we create a machine like the following (using [`NxtMachine`][NxtMachine]):

```java
// preparation (create an BluetoothDevice with MAC address)
BluetoothAdapter adapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
BluetoothDevice device = adapter.getRemoteDevice(address);

NxtMachine machine = new NxtMachine(new BluetoothCommunicator(device));
```

## Development setup
Please fork this repository, modify it and send Pull Request.

If you want to make more machines available like Drone,
you can follow the below steps.

1. Make a folder in [`model`][model] folder
The new folder should be named after your device like `drone`.

2. Implement an implementation of `MachineBase` and related classes
There are 3 examples ([ev3][ev3], [nxt][nxt], [pile][pile]).
They contain implementations of `MachineBase` and Input/Output port classes, etc.
